                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subject 
                I learned were current, if not more so, 
                in the company i joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's 
                worth.

                "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                I have been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for 
                the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! 
                I enrolled shortly thereafter. the next 12 weeks was the best
                - and most grueling - time of my life since completing the course,
                I've successfully switched careers, working as a software Engineer 
                at VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never 
                written a line of code. I needed some 
                structure from professionals who can 
                help me learn programming step by step. 
                I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say 
                wonderful things about the program. 
                The entire curriculum and staff did 
                not dissapoint. They were very hands-on 
                and I never had to wait long for 
                assistance. The agile team project, 
                in particular, was outstanding. 
                It took my learning to the next level 
                in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                In fac, I've often referred to it during 
                interviews as an example of my development 
                experience. It certtainly helped me land 
                a job as a full-stack developer after 
                receiving multiple offers. 100% recommended"

                Awesome teaching support from TAs who did 
                bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from 
                them and learning from their experience was 
                easy.

                "The staff seems genuinely concern about my 
                progress which I find really refreshing. 
                The program gave me the confidence necessary 
                to be able to go out in the world and present 
                myself as a capable junior developer. 
                The standard is above the rest. You will get 
                the personal attention you need from an 
                incredible community of smart and amazing 
                people."
